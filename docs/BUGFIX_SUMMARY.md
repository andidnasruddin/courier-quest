# Bug Fix Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Issues Fixed:** 3 critical errors preventing project from running

---

## Errors Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Unrecognized UID: "uid://eafdg8nge6r6"

**Problem:**
- `project.godot` referenced old main scene UID that didn't exist
- Caused endless error spam

**Solution:**
- Updated `run/main_scene` to point to `res://scenes/tests/test_vehicle.tscn`

**File Changed:**
- `project.godot` line 14

---

### 2. ‚ùå File not found: 'res://components/look_ahead_camera.gd'

**Problem:**
- Camera file was named `LookAheadCamera.gd` (PascalCase)
- Vehicle scene expected `look_ahead_camera.gd` (snake_case)
- Violated coding standards (should use snake_case)

**Solution:**
- Renamed file to `look_ahead_camera.gd`
- Updated `.uid` file accordingly

**Files Changed:**
- `components/LookAheadCamera.gd` ‚Üí `components/look_ahead_camera.gd`

---

### 3. ‚ùå Class "LookAheadCamera" hides a global script class

**Problem:**
- `class_name LookAheadCamera` declaration conflicted with file naming
- Godot confused about which LookAheadCamera to use

**Solution:**
- Removed `class_name` declaration
- Camera is now referenced by file path only
- Added documentation header instead

**File Changed:**
- `components/look_ahead_camera.gd` line 1-6

---

## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Should Now Work

**Main Scene:**
- Set to `res://scenes/tests/test_vehicle.tscn`
- F5 will launch vehicle test scene

**All Files:**
- Follow snake_case naming convention
- No UID conflicts
- No class name conflicts

### üéÆ How to Test

1. **Close Godot completely** (if open)
2. **Reopen project**
3. **Press F5** (or click Play)
4. Should load vehicle test scene automatically

### üîß If Still Having Issues

**Try:**
1. Project ‚Üí Reload Current Project
2. Delete `.godot` folder again and reopen
3. Check console for any new errors

**Expected Behavior:**

- Van visible (brown/orange rectangle)
- Can press F to enter van

## Files Modified

```
project.godot                          (main scene path)
components/look_ahead_camera.gd        (renamed, class_name removed)
components/look_ahead_camera.gd.uid    (renamed)
```

## Files Created

```
docs/BUGFIX_SUMMARY.md  (this file)
```

## Prevention

**Going Forward:**
- Always use snake_case for file names
- Avoid `class_name` unless truly needed for global access
- Use direct file paths instead of UIDs when possible
- Keep `.godot` folder in `.gitignore` (already done)
